# Introduction #
This is a simple python script that allows you to tweet status updates from
the command line.

The script will post each line of the file as an individual status update. If a
line is more than 140 characters in length, the update may fail. The script can
automatically truncate a line to this limit with the `--truncate` command line
option.

This script perform no interpretation of the input nor any scrubbing of the
text for special characters.

# Prerequisites #
* Python 2.7 or 3.0+
* Python tweepy library

# Installation #
The module can be installed using the setup script:
```
sudo python setup.py install
```

This will install the ftweet.py module and an ftweet executable script.

# Configuration #
The authentication tokens used to access Twitter are stored separately from
the python script in a JSON file. This contains tokens and secrets for both
the API and access tokens. These access tokens can be configured by creating
a Twitter App (https://apps.twitter.com).

The configuration file must have the following format:
```
{
    "api_key": <consumer key (API key) string>,
    "api_secret": <consumer secret (API secret) string>,
    "token": <access token string>,
    "token_secret": <access token secret string>
}
```

Note that the keys must be quoted strings. See http://json.org for more
information about the JSON format.

By default, ftweet looks for the configuration file in the user's home
directory named `.ftweet`. You can also pass in a configuration file
using command line argument `--config`.

# Example Use #
The genesis of this project was the desire to post Snort alerts to Twitter.
What good are intrusion alerts if they don't show up on your smartphone? The
ftweet script is designed to be used in conjunction with other BSD/Linux
utilities, or stand-alone on the command line.

Tweeting a simple status update:
```
echo "Hello World!" | ftweet
```

Monitoring for sudo events from the sylog, truncating the line if necessary:
```
tail -f /var/log/auth.log | grep sudo | ftweet --truncate
```

Using in combination with swatch to monitor for snort alerts. The `~/.swatchrc`
file may look like:
```
watchfor /snort\[\d{1,5}\]:/
pipe /bin/sed -r -f ~/snort/my_scrub_rules.sed | ftweet --truncate
```
